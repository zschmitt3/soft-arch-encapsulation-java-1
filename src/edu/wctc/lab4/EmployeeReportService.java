 * This class simulates a simple type of reporting service that produces output.
 * That's it's Single Responsibility. Notice how easy it would be to change the
 * code in the outputReport method to use a JOptionPane for GUI output instead
 * of using the current console output. And notice that making this change would
 * not cause problems with any other classes. Very flexible!
