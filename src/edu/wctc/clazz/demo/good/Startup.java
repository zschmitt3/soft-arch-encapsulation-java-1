/**
 * This demo is an example of Class encapsulation, where entire classes of
 * objects are hidden (encapsulated) from the calling code.
 *
 * This hiding of other classes reduces dependencies that limit flexibility. It
 * also makes the calling code (the code in this class) simpler by hiding
 * details of how the work is performed. "Principle of Least Knowledge" is an
 * important design principle that states that any given class should know the
 * least possible about other classes in the system.
 *
 * Think about how you use your real Car. You don't have to know how a Car works
 * to start the car. You just have to know that you must turn the key. All off
 * the other technical details (there are many!!) are hidden (encapsulated) by
 * that key switch. You know as little as possible about how the rest of the car
 * works.
